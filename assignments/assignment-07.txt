4. What is SPA?

Ans- SPA stands for Single Page Application. It loads a HTML page and change its content dynamically as the user interact with the application.

5. What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?

Ans- Server side routing

-> The client (i.e., browser) makes a request to the server for a particular page.
-> The server uses the identifiers in the URL pathname to retrieve the relevant data from its database.
-> The server populates a template (HTML document) with this data.
-> The server returns the template along with other assets like CSS/images to the client.
-> The client renders these assets.
-> For subsequent route changes, the client again sends a new request to the server, and the above is repeated.

Client side routing

-> The client makes an initial request to the server.
-> The server responds with a primary HTML document (the single page of the SPA) and associated assets (e.g., JavaScript, CSS).
-> The client interprets the JavaScript, and the app logic determines which content to display based on the URL path.
-> For subsequent route changes, the JavaScript updates the browserâ€™s history and displayed content without a full page reload.
